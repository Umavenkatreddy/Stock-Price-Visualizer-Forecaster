# Stock Price Visualizer & Forecaster

## Overview
This project is a **Stock Price Visualizer & Forecaster** designed to help users analyze and predict stock market trends. The system integrates **machine learning models** and **data visualization** to provide insights into stock price movements and future trends.

## Introduction
Stock trading is a significant investment activity, and predicting stock prices is crucial for financial decision-making. This project aims to analyze stock market trends and visualize stock price movements using **supervised learning algorithms** and **interactive visualizations**.

## Motivation
Predicting stock values offers enormous profit opportunities, making it an attractive research area. Even a fraction of a second's knowledge of a stock's worth can result in large earnings. However, stock markets are volatile, seasonal, and influenced by multiple factors, making accurate predictions challenging. This project uses technology to aid in better forecasting and visualization.

## Problem Statement
Existing stock market prediction models often suffer from low accuracy due to limited training datasets and a lack of real-world implementations. This project addresses these limitations by:
- Using **machine learning models** with diverse feature sets for improved accuracy.
- Creating an **intuitive and accessible web application** for stock visualization.
- Providing a **user-friendly interface** for financial data analysis and stock trend predictions.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to develop a **single-page web application** using **Dash (a Python framework)** that enables users to:
- View **company information** (logo, registered name, and description) based on stock code input.
- Visualize **stock price trends** through dynamic plots.
- Predict **future stock prices** using machine learning models based on user-inputted dates.
- Improve investment decision-making through data-driven insights.

## System Design
### Architecture
The system follows a **client-server** architecture where the frontend (Dash web application) interacts with the backend (Python machine learning models and APIs) to process stock data and provide visual insights.

### Data Flow
1. **User Input**: The user provides a stock code and date range.
2. **Data Retrieval**: The system fetches historical stock data using the `yfinance` library.
3. **Visualization**: The retrieved data is displayed in dynamic graphs.
4. **Prediction**: The system applies machine learning models to forecast future stock prices.
5. **Output Display**: The predicted stock prices are presented to the user.

## Features
- **Stock Data Retrieval**: Uses the `yfinance` library to fetch historical stock data.
- **Interactive Visualizations**: Dynamic stock trend plots for better understanding.
- **Stock Price Prediction**: Machine learning models for future stock price estimation.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Built with Dash for seamless interaction.

## Tech Stack

```

## Usage
1. Enter the **stock code** of the company you want to analyze.
2. View **stock details**, company information, and price trends.
3. Input a **date range** to get predicted stock prices.
4. Use the insights to make **informed investment decisions**.

## Future Enhancements
